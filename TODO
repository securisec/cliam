Todo:
  ☐ trap interrupts and exit cleanly
  ☐ enumerate functions should return an array of valid permissions
  ☐ refactor goroutine runners as DRY
  ☐ firebase with config
  ☐ figure out a way to have tab complete for multiple known values
  ☐ when using tokens, validate the expiration of the token (done: azure)
  ☐ ability to test a specific permission for any cloud provider. will help with automation

Bug:

AWS:
  ☐ for services that require a body, it may be responding with a 404 if permission is valid
  ☐ 🚧 aws endpoint support

GCP:
  ☐ curl builder for requests

Firebase:
  ☐ authencated scan
  ☐ curl builder for requests

Azure:
  
Helpers:
    
Cli:
  ☐ if access key starts with ASIA, then token is required maybe?
  ☐ spinner with backwards count of remaining calls?
  ☐ move more verbose logging to the -v flag in the cli
