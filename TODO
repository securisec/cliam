Todo:
  ☐ ability to provide custom query params or body for complicated calls
  ☐ trap interrupts and exit cleanly
  ☐ context with timeout for requests
  ☐ function that can take array of services and check permissions
  ☐ enumerate functions should return an array of valid permissions
  ☐ refactor goroutine runners as DRY

Bug:
  ☐ save output doesnt work for aws
  ☐ add save output to gcp rest calls

AWS:
  ☐ for services that require a body, it may be responding with a 404 if permission is valid
  ☐ aws serverless permissions subcommand
  
Helpers:
  ☐ helper functions for testing arbitrary permissions
    
Cli:
  ☐ support providing profiles from aws credentials file
  ☐ if access key starts with ASIA, then token is required maybe?
  ☐ spinner with backwards count of remaining calls?
  ☐ region completer
  ☐ read specific aws profile
