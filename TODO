Todo:
  ☐ trap interrupts and exit cleanly
  ☐ enumerate functions should return an array of valid permissions
  ☐ refactor goroutine runners as DRY
  ☐ firebase with config
  ☐ figure out a way to have tab complete for multiple known values
  ☐ when using tokens, validate the expiration of the token (done: azure)
  ☐ ability to test a specific permission for any cloud provider. will help with automation
  ☐ session-json for aws is not the right format
  ☐ gcp set parent as project if one is not set. get project from json file
  ☐ aws all regions flag
  ☐ aws : helper : cognito : get unauth creds
  ☐ gcp : helper : iam : get service accounts and their roles
  ☐ optionally pass known values as a json file
  ☐ flag that will show all possible valid keys for known values
  ☐ 🐛 bug with debug message which says azure although it is aws
  ☐ 💚 🐛 build for arm mac doesnt work on zsh
  ☐ ✨ sas-token enumeration for azure
  ☐ 💡 local database?
  ☐ azure util list public blob storage
  ☐ 💡 if the same known value is passed multiple types, iterate over each of them
  ☐ ✨ save all enumerated permissions as json
  🐙 disable color is no tty

Cli:
  ☐ if access key starts with ASIA, then token is required maybe?
  ☐ spinner with backwards count of remaining calls?
  ☐ move more verbose logging to the -v flag in the cli

  ✔ aws set profile based on obtained creds/profiles/creds file
  ✔ set cliam aws profile based on current creds
  ✔ profile autocompleter for aws
  ✔ for extra scanning, sometime if there is only one resource, it shows up as an object instead of an array. like sns list topics and s3 list bucket
  ✔ azure get resource group name automatically
  ✔ 🚀 set envar as default value for flags
  ✔ 🐛 cli args passed for aws is still prompting for creds
  ✔ 🐛 looks like secret for aws when passed as a flag is wrong for static credentials
