Todo:
  ☐ trap interrupts and exit cleanly
  ☐ enumerate functions should return an array of valid permissions
  ☐ refactor goroutine runners as DRY
  ☐ firebase with config
  ☐ figure out a way to have tab complete for multiple known values
  ☐ when using tokens, validate the expiration of the token (done: azure)
  ☐ ability to test a specific permission for any cloud provider. will help with automation
  ☐ session-json for aws is not the right format
  ☐ gcp set parent as project if one is not set. get project from json file
  ☐ aws all regions flag
  ☐ aws : helper : ebs : ability for bruteforcing all regions for specific aws permission
  ☐ aws : helper : sts : get caller identity
  ☐ aws : helper : cognito : get unauth creds
  ☐ gcp : helper : iam : get service accounts and their roles
  ☐ optionally pass known values as a json file
  ☐ if session-json is being used, check if expiration is valid
  ☐ flag that will show all possible valid keys for known values

Helpers:

Bug:

AWS:

GCP:
  ☐ curl builder for requests

Firebase:
  ☐ authencated scan
  ☐ curl builder for requests

Azure:
  
Helpers:
    
Cli:
  ☐ if access key starts with ASIA, then token is required maybe?
  ☐ spinner with backwards count of remaining calls?
  ☐ move more verbose logging to the -v flag in the cli
